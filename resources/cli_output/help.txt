DESCRIPTION
  web-monitor scrapes websites for recurring elements (articles, products, etc.)
  and notifies you of new or changed content via Matrix, RSS, stdout, or custom scripts.

  --once, -o          Run monitoring once; supports:
    --path, -p        Specify config file path

PROJECT FILES
  config.json         Configuration file (see README for details)
  data/               Database, RSS feeds, and logs
  user/               User scripts (filters, notifications, URL lists)

CONFIGURATION HIGHLIGHTS
  - frequency: scrape interval (e.g., "12m 10s")
  - browser: "none", "firefox", or "chrome" (for JS rendering)
  - messengers: specify notification channels (matrix, rss, print, notify-send, or custom scripts)
  - monitors: define targets, selectors, filters, and scrape behavior

NOTES
  - Java 11 required; Firefox/Chrome + compatible driver needed for JS-heavy sites.
  - Config changes may reset monitored data to avoid false notifications.
  - Detailed docs available in README.md and online.
